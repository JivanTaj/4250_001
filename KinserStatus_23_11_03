Friday

Attended the Assessment Committee meetings (Sr Exit Exam related)
	People from the university assessment department attended to explain some workflows
	Big takeaways is that 
		there are documents workflows for continuous improvement for Computing Assessment
		now is a good time to make significant changes to the sr exit exam (between certifications)
	Some debate over how to motivate students to try their best on the exam
	I kept a positive and professional attitude (E for me)

Checked emails periodically throughout the evening in case a student needed something time critical

Saturday
Finished SE I reports (both sections) 
	One section in the morning, the other in the afternoon/evening
Planned out my work to replace kitchen counter with mosaic tile
Took off the kitchen counter, used it as a template to cut the underlayment for tile
	Had to remove the faucet so now I don't have water in the kitchen until I'm done
Installed the underlayment
Did some final cleanup work on the raised beds
Tore down the beaver wall

Sunday
Processed reports for 1 section of SE II
Arrived even earlier to church, setup streaming equipment and the hand bells
	One the mic batteries was low so I swapped them out before the priest clipped it on
	Dr. Bidgood ran the equipment this week 
	My wife is out of town so I processed donations and make announcements for her
	Practiced more songs after service, then put the bells away
	Distributed the daily stocking bags (3 bags per day for food pantry and caring cabinet)  
Family stuff came up and lost my window to do the tile install

Did a walkthrough of a house for sale as a favor (found a bomb shelter noone knew about)
Even though I got home later than planned, I was able to get the tile counter installed
	Still need to grout it (have to let the mortar dry first)
	My kitchen is a mess (dirty dishes because I have no water, tools everwhere,
		this is why I'm doing it while my wife is out of town)
Did a bunch of laundry inbetween steps of tile installation

Tuesday
Arrived early
Drafted my notes for SE II based on my observations of their reports over the weekend
